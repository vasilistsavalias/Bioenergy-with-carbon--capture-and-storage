# Bioenergy with carbon  capture and storage
 A technology that combats climate change and reduces carbon footprint in the atmosphere.

Abstract: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a pioneering climate mitigation technology that holds significant promise in ameliorating the adverse effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate system. BECCS encompasses a multifaceted approach that integrates the utilization of organic biomass resources, such as agricultural residues, forestry residues, or dedicated energy crops, for the generation of bioenergy through processes like combustion or gasification. Subsequently, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions arising from bioenergy production are captured and sequestered, primarily through geological storage or advanced utilization techniques. This innovative strategy addresses climate change mitigation by not only providing a source of renewable energy but also actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere, effectively leading to negative emissions. The significance of BECCS lies in its capacity to achieve net-negative emissions, wherein the amount of CO2 removed surpasses the emissions generated during bioenergy production, thereby contributing to the reduction of the atmospheric carbon footprint. Consequently, BECCS emerges as a crucial tool in the portfolio of climate change mitigation strategies, offering a pathway to stabilize global temperatures and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change through the sustainable utilization of biomass resources and the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions.
